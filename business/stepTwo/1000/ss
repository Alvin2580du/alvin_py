This doesnt even include people who are not on FB or unaware of the FB page... since Verizon didnt announce on their site; but FB only.
Im getting a Smart TV and/or a Roku. Im beyond sick of at&t U-verse and their ignorant ass technicians.

@ATT FUCK YOU at&t ; &amp; your fucking data plan
T-Mobile cut my phone off cuz of some money I didnt know I owed them. Thanks a lot T-Mobile!! &gt;.&lt;

@RitaTrichur @jpnKevin_T Verizon is not exactly a saint. Not a slam dunk that its entry in Canada would fix competition problems.
Shawty put up a Instagram of herself just now. Lemme call at&t later so they can cut off my services forever.
Goodbye Verizon Wireless. 6 years; 7 months and IM OUT.
@DJTEN23 The merger; no contract plans; at&t merger break up spectrum; LTE and the iPhone has made T-Mobile a solid contender.
@scuttlefield Ive been on Sprint for a while so I still feel the sting (mostly). But Im switching to at&t for this.
The 1020 is looking good but $300 for 2 year contract with at&t is a little bit to pricy.
T-Mobile Need To Get It Together With This 4g Shit Keep Leaving
Not too bad on T-Mobile US.30GB this month; no tethering. No throttling either.https://t.co/4l8tak5lB5
Verizon reception with 4GB &gt; any other carrier reception with unlimited data
Pre-2013 T-Mobile was wack; but once they got the iPhone; got rid of contracts; and added 6 month upgrades they became the best.
@hi_its_nicola @Louquera Also; Verizon limits conference calls to three-way; but gsm carriers like T-Mo/at&t allow 5; plus live switching
Why dont the Giants just tow a barge full of at&t garbage out into the cove. Let the seagulls have it and leave the stadium alone.
Verizon please switch to similar no contract plans like t mobile
