    "1. This assignment accounts for 22% of your final mark.\n",

    "    - 7% from the Business Analytics component\n",
    "1. This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "2. The assignment is due before **17:00 26th October 2018**. The late penalty for the assignment is 10% of the assigned mark per day, starting after 5pm on the due date. The closing date **5pm 2nd November 2018** is the last date on which an assessment will be accepted for marking. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You are employed as a Data Scientist at a telecommunications company. One of the biggest issues facing the company is minimising customer churn. Customer churn is when a customer changes provider. The business is interested in analysing and predicting churn since the cost of acquiring new customers is higher than retaining existing customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly problematic for the telecommunications industry as changing telecommunications provider is relatively easy. There are also a large number of price competitive providers to choose from, which encourages churning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to help the marketing department to undertake the following:\n",
    "- Investigate why and which customers churn\n",
    "- Discover retention oppurtunities and strategies\n",
    "- Identify current customers that are likely to churn so that the retention strategy can be applied\n",
    "- Identify potential customers so that the incentive strategy can be applied\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1:\n",
    "- churn_survey.json\n",

    "Part 2:\n",
    "- tweets.db\n",

    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment will be automatically marked. Any deviation from the stated output form will be marked as an incorrect answer. It is your responsibility to check that the output matches the given template or example for each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to Submit\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit only your .ipynb file. You can choose to use this file as a template OR start from scratch. Just make sure that running your notebook generates all the answers!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filename\n",
    "\n",
    "The filename must be \"BUSS6002_MKBA_STUDENTID.ipynb\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loading the data files when marking\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run your notebook in the same directory as the data files. We will assume the original file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output for each question should be saved to the same directory as the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checking the format of your output files\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created ED Challenges for each question. The challenges will tell you if the FORMAT of your output file is correct. It does not tell you if your answer is correct. Please test your output files on Ed before submitting your assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "We will automatically run your notebook. Each notebook will be given a maximum of 1 minute to be completed. Please ensure any model training or optimisation will be easily completed in this time frame.\n",
