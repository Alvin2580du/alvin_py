","   the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation .  for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible .   several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared . in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings) .   the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge .  under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice . more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .   in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory .

"," the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the  development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction  depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream  of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in  practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight  and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information  is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation  between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock  waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain  unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of  the paper .

","   the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties .  there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow .  the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development .  since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream .  however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .
